## HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Problem Set

Some of the data you will need is in the 'data' folder. For this week, you will use the CSV of scraped tweets in the Cambridge area and plot them on a Leaflet map. Place this Leaflet 

### Instructions

For this Problem Set:

Customize your website on Github by using Leaflet and JavaScript to add a Leaflet map of Cambridge showing tweets you have scraped.

Using data from Boston, this Leaflet map should contain:

* At least 1 GeoJSON layer (ie Boston and Cambridge Neighborhoods)
* 1 CSV layer
* make one of the layers interactive (ie with a popup showing tweet ID or tweet time)
* 1 basemap tile layer (such as openstreetmap or Stamen)

On your website, get rid of the cat image, replace it with one of your own :)

### Bonus Exercise!

Explore the [Bl.ocks](http://bl.ocks.org/) website. Locate and find one Bl.ock that you can set up on your site. You don't need to do any customization or change data at this point, we will explore that in subsequent weeks. Stand up the Bl.ock you find on your website.
