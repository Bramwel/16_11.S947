# Front End Environments
## HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Problem Set

### Instructions

For this Problem Set:

Create a project homepage on your Github site that you can use to host your project and data visualizations. It is up to you how to structure it. One team member can set up a website in their account for the team and others can commit and collaborate.

Also, develop a base level branding (project name, logo, and color scheme) for your team and project. Customize your website by changing fonts, colors, and images that go with your project.

On your website:

1. Include your branding in your design
2. Name your project team and include a short summary of your project
2. Include a copy of your revised mid-term presentation on your site
