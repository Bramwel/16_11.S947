# Data Visualization with D3
## Intro to D3: Make a Chart

For the PSET this week, we are going to create a bar chart using the Health Coverage dataset you used for the county map of the United States in the last PSET.

We would like you to create the following bar chart showing healthcare coverage in the 14 counties of Massachusetts.

1. Extract the Counties of Massachusetts from the dataset.
2. Show the data in a **Stacked Bar Chart** with the stacks bars of the data representing the percentages with no healthcare, public health care, and private healthcare. The total height of the bar should be the sum (100%).
3. Display data using the following.

* Black - No Healthcare
* Blue - Public Healthcare
* Red - Private Healthcare

4. Create a hover over each that shows the percentage of each for each county.
5. Add source information and a legend.
